# Multi-Robot Search and Rescue Using Deep Image Processing, SLAM, AMCL, and Optimized Communication

This repository contains the code, models, and documentation for the thesis titled:

**"Optimizing Multi-Robot Collaboration Using Deep Image Processing and Communication Protocols for Search and Rescue Operations"**

## ðŸ“– Overview

This research proposes a modular, scalable system for autonomous multi-robot search and rescue (SAR) operations in disaster environments. The system leverages:

- **Deep Learning** (for real-time victim and obstacle detection using CNNs)
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** (for environment mapping)
- **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)** (for robust robot localization)
- **Optimized Communication Protocols** (for efficient, real-time data sharing)
- **Multi-Robot Coordination** (for distributed task allocation and path planning)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Enable real-time visual detection of victims/obstacles via CNN-based processing.
- Share only mission-critical information to reduce bandwidth usage.
- Improve localization and mapping in GPS-denied environments using SLAM and AMCL.
- Maximize area coverage and minimize redundancy in multi-robot navigation.
